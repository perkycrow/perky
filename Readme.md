# Perky

A modular framework for JavaScript game development.

## Overview

Perky is a lightweight, modular architecture for building interactive applications and games in JavaScript. It provides a structured approach to:

- Application lifecycle management
- Event-driven communication
- Advanced input handling
- Resource loading and management
- Action dispatching
- Optimized game loop
- 2D Canvas rendering
- Mathematical utilities
- UI components
- Three.js integration

## Project Structure

The framework is divided into several modules:

- `core`: Foundational modules providing the basic structure and functionality (engine, registry, notifications, etc.)
- `application`: Implementation components for building web-based interactive applications
- `game`: Game loop and base classes for game development
- `canvas`: 2D rendering system with shapes, images, and groups
- `math`: Mathematical utilities including vector operations (vec2, vec3, vec4)
- `input`: Comprehensive input handling system supporting keyboard, mouse, and gamepad
- `ui`: User interface components (FPS counter, logger, toolbar, code display)
- `three`: Three.js integration for 3D games and applications
- `audio`: Audio system integration (planned)
- `examples`: Working examples demonstrating framework features

## Philosophy

Perky emphasizes flexibility, allowing developers to use only the components they need while maintaining a consistent architecture throughout the project. The framework promotes:

- A modular approach where each component has a single responsibility
- Event-based communication between components
- Testable code with comprehensive unit tests
- Extensibility to accommodate different types of projects
