# Perky

A modular framework for JavaScript game development.

## Overview

Perky is a lightweight, modular architecture for building interactive applications and games in JavaScript. It provides a structured approach to:

- Application lifecycle management
- Event-driven communication
- Input handling (keyboard, mouse)
- Resource loading and management
- Action dispatching
- Optimized game loop
- UI components
- Three.js integration

## Project Structure

The framework is divided into several modules:

- `core`: Foundational modules providing the basic structure and functionality (engine, registry, notifications, etc.)
- `application`: Implementation components for building web-based interactive applications
- `game`: Game loop and base classes for game development
- `ui`: User interface components (FPS counter, logger, toolbar, code display)
- `three`: Three.js integration for 3D games and applications

## Philosophy

Perky emphasizes flexibility, allowing developers to use only the components they need while maintaining a consistent architecture throughout the project. The framework promotes:

- A modular approach where each component has a single responsibility
- Event-based communication between components
- Testable code with comprehensive unit tests
- Extensibility to accommodate different types of projects
