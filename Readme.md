# Perky

A modular framework for JavaScript game development.

## Overview

Perky is a lightweight, modular architecture for building interactive applications and games in JavaScript. It provides a structured approach to:

- Application lifecycle management
- Event-driven communication
- Input handling (keyboard, mouse)
- Resource loading and management
- Action dispatching

The framework is divided into two main parts:
- `core`: Foundational modules providing the basic structure and functionality
- `application`: Implementation components for building web-based interactive applications

Perky emphasizes flexibility, allowing developers to use only the components they need while maintaining a consistent architecture throughout the project.
