# Perky Framework

A modular framework for JavaScript game development and interactive applications.

> **Warning**: Perky is under active development. The API is unstable and breaking changes happen frequently. Not recommended for production use yet.

## Vision

**Everything works together. Nothing is required.**

Perky is a complete ecosystem where each piece stands on its own. Use the full stack or pick what you need. Swap any module for your own.

### Zero Dependencies

Zero runtime dependencies. The only devDependencies are tools like ESLint and Vitest. Your bundle stays lean.

### The Perky Way

Everything is a **PerkyModule** - one base class that handles identity, lifecycle, children, events, and delegation. Learn it once, use it everywhere.

### What's Included

- **Rendering** - Canvas2D, WebGL, and HTML renderers with cameras, layers, sprites, and post-processing
- **Input** - Keyboard, mouse, and gamepad with action binding
- **Collision** - Detection and resolution with spatial partitioning
- **Math** - Vectors, easing, random, grids, pathfinding
- **Assets** - Loaders for images, audio, fonts, JSON, and more

### Developer Tooling

- **Perky Explorer** - Inspect your module tree in real-time
- **Perky Logger** - In-game console with log levels and filters
- **Inspectors** - Specialized panels for textures, inputs, performance, and more

All built as Web Components. Drop them in, debug visually.

Now go build something. Stay perky.
