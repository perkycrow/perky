# Project Roadmap

## Input System Enhancements
- Enhance InputMapper to record additional data (mouse coordinates, modifier keys like Alt or Control)
- Improve setInputFor to accept an input object for more customization (e.g., trigger action on keyup instead of keydown)

## Input Device Support
- Create MidiObserver following the InputObserver pattern for MIDI keyboard support
- Develop GamepadObserver using the same observer pattern for gamepad integration

## Audio Framework
- Build AudioPlayer based on ToneJS
- Implement Ableton-inspired audio tools leveraging ToneJS capabilities
- Design sound management system optimized for game development

## Graphics Foundation
- Develop ThreeGame class that provides necessary infrastructure for 2D/3D game creation with ThreeJS

## Image Processing Utilities
- Create Canvas-based image manipulation tools for texture and image generation
- Implement Photoshop-inspired editing features
- Integrate concepts from libraries like PaperJS and EaselJS

## UI Components
- Develop a suite of generic UI elements for custom tool creation
- Create standard game interface components (settings menus, keybinding interfaces, etc.)
- Design flexible and reusable UI framework adaptable to different game types

## PWA Tools
- Implement service worker management for offline capabilities
- Create manifest.json generator and configurator
- Develop cache strategies for assets and application data
- Build installation prompts and update notification system

## Collision Detection
- Implement 2D collision detection (AABB, circle, polygon)
- Develop 3D collision systems (bounding box, sphere, mesh-based)
- Create spatial partitioning for performance optimization
- Design collision response and physics reaction framework
