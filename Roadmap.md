## Collision Detection
- Implement 2D collision detection (AABB, circle, polygon)
- Develop 3D collision systems (bounding box, sphere, mesh-based)
- Create spatial partitioning for performance optimization
- Design collision response and physics reaction framework

## Project Generators
- Develop Rails-inspired project scaffolding system
- Create game templates with preconfigured settings:
  - Side-scroller template with platformer physics and camera setup
  - Third-person shooter (TPS) template with character controls and camera
  - First-person shooter (FPS) template with movement and weapon systems
- Implement standard web application template for non-game projects
- Build customizable template system with configurable options
- Design command-line interface for generator invocation

## Architecture
